      "Response1: Dear friend, it’s hard to believe that you’re leaving us. I’m going to miss you so much, and it’s going to be difficult to adjust to life without you here. I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for all the amazing times we’ve shared together. From the late-night conversations to the impromptu adventures, you’ve been a constant source of joy and inspiration in my life.  I’m so proud of you for taking this step and embarking on a new adventure. I know it’s not easy to leave behind everything you know and start over in a new place, but I have no doubt that you’ll thrive. Your courage, kindness, and determination have always been an inspiration to me, and I have no doubt that you’ll continue to make a positive impact on the world around you.  Even though you’ll be far away, please know that you’ll always have a special place in my heart. I’m excited to see what the future holds for you and can’t wait to hear all about your new experiences and adventures. Please keep in touch, and know that you’re always welcome back here in the city whenever you want to visit. Wishing you all the best in your new home!\n",
      "Response2: My dear friend, as you prepare to move out of the city, I wanted to send you a heartfelt farewell message. We have been through so much together over the years, from the ups and downs of life to the simple pleasures of coffee or dinner together. You have been such an important part of my life here, and it is hard to imagine the city without you. Though you are moving away, I know that true friendships transcend distance.  We will find ways to stay in touch and visit when we can. The memories we have made together will remain with me wherever I go. You are following your dreams and starting an exciting new chapter, and while I will miss you dearly, I wish you all the happiness and success in your next adventure. Though life brings changes, some things remain constant - and our friendship is one of those constants.  As you pack up and head off to your new home, know that a part of my heart goes with you. But that part will remain, keeping close the laughter we have shared and reminding me of the bond we will always have. This is not goodbye, just until we meet again.\n"
